# Create and ingest data with a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse

## Overview 
The purpose of this lab is to provide hands-on experience in creating and managing a scalable and flexible data store using Microsoft Fabric's Lakehouse. Participants will learn to integrate the capabilities of both data lakes and data warehouses for efficient big data processing and analysis.

The utilized technical specifications are as follows:

  1. Power BI: For data visualization and reporting.
  2. Power Query: For creating visual data transformation queries.
  3. OneLake: Scalable storage layer based on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2.
  4. Apache Spark: Compute engine for big data processing.
  5. SQL: Query engine for relational data analysis.
  6. Delta Lake: Open source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.


## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will enhance your data management and analysis skills by leveraging Microsoft Fabric's AI-powered tools. You will:

- **Create a Microsoft Fabric Workspace**: Set up a workspace with Fabric capacity enabled.
- **Set Up a Lakehouse**: Create and configure a Lakehouse for scalable data storage and processing.
- **Ingest Data**: Upload and manage data files within the Lakehouse.
- **Convert Files to Tables**: Load data from files into structured tables that can be queried.
- **Run SQL Queries**: Utilize SQL to perform data analysis on the Lakehouse tables.
- **Create Visual Queries**: Use Power Query to transform and visualize data.
- **Build Reports**: Develop and save Power BI reports based on the ingested data.
