# Get Started with Data Warehouses and Ingesting Data with Dataflows Gen2 with Microsoft Fabric

## Overall Estimated Duration: 2 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you'll use Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric to ingest, transform, and standardize data, and  analyzing the data in a relational data warehouse using SQL for querying and visualization.The lab will include the following exercises: 
- **Create and use a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric** : Learn to effectively ingest and transform data using Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric. Connect data sources, standardize the data, and efficiently load it to Lakehouse.
- **Analyze data in a Data Warehouse** : Learn to create and manage a relational data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric. Utilize SQL to perform queries and visualizations.

## Objective

Explore dataflows, data warehousing, and reporting in Microsoft Fabric. By the end of this lab, You will be able to:
- Create and use Dataflows (Gen2) for data ingestion and transformation
- Manage and standardize data for analysis in Lakehouses or other destinations 
- Build and manage a relational data warehouse using Microsoft Fabric's SQL tools
- Generate reports and visualizations for data-driven decision-making

## Pre-requisites

- Fundamental knowledge on Microsoft Fabric
- Basic understanding of Data Analytics

## Architecture

This lab begins with setting up a workspace and a Lakehouse in the Data Engineering area. Next, Dataflows (Gen2) are created to import and configure data sources. These dataflows are then integrated into a pipeline for additional processing. Then  Data Warehouse is created, where tables are created and structured. Following this, data is queried and views are created for further analysis. Finally, visual queries are developed to enable data visualization and provide insights.

## Explanation of Components

- **Workspace** : Acts as the central hub for organizing and managing data engineering activities in this lab, facilitating the setup and coordination of various components.
- **Lakehouse** : Provides a unified storage solution for raw and processed data, supporting data ingestion and transformation processes crucial for this lab's analytics workflow.
- **Dataflows (Gen2)** : Used to ingest, transform, and standardize data from diverse sources, ensuring clean and consistent data is available for further analysis and reporting in this lab.
- **Data Warehouse** : Serves as the structured storage solution for organizing and analyzing large datasets, enabling efficient querying and reporting for comprehensive data insights in this lab.
- **Pipeline** : Orchestrates the movement and transformation of data, ensuring seamless integration and data flow between different components.
- **Visual Query Tool** :  Enables the creation of visual queries and views, allowing participants to easily analyze and visualize data, and draw actionable insights from the lab's dataset.

**Fabric trial provides access to most features, but excludes Copilot, private links, and trusted workspace access ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial#overview-of-the-trial-capacity)).**
