# Get started with Real-Time Analytics and Data science with Microsoft Fabric

This hands-on lab provides an immersive experience in real-time analytics and data science using Microsoft Fabric. We've set up a seamless environment for you to explore and learn about Microsoft Fabric services. 

## Objectives

- **Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric** : In this lab, you'll learn how to process and analyze real-time data using Microsoft Fabric. You'll explore key services such as event processing, data streaming, and analytics integration to gain insights from live data efficiently.
- **Data science in Microsoft Fabric** : In this lab, you'll learn how to leverage Microsoft Fabric for data science, from data preparation to model training and deployment. 

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cloud computing and data analytics concepts.  
- Familiarity with Microsoft Azure services.  
- A Microsoft Fabric-enabled workspace with necessary permissions.  
- Access to Microsoft Fabric services such as OneLake, Data Engineering, and Data Science experiences.  

## Architecture

 These labs utilize a step-by-step workflow for data processing and machine learning processes. Lab 1 focuses on setting up a workspace, querying data with KQL, and generating PBI reports. Lab 2 involves uploading files in the datalake, training machine learning models, conducting experiments with MLflow, and saving the model and notebook.
